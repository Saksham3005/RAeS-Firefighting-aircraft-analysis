# RAeS-Firefighting-aircraft-analysis

This repository contains the analysis files and results for the Performance and Stability Analysis of a Firefighting Aircraft.  
The project focuses on evaluating the aerodynamic performance and stability characteristics using OpenVSP for geometry modeling and ANSYS Fluent as the CFD solver.

üöÄ **Objectives**  
Performance Analysis: Evaluate aerodynamic characteristics such as lift, drag, and pressure distribution using CFD simulations in ANSYS Fluent.  
Stability Analysis: Investigate the static and dynamic stability of the aircraft, with a focus on center of gravity (CG) positioning, stability margins, and control surface effects.  
Firefighting Adaptations: Analyze the impact of additional firefighting equipment on performance and stability.  


üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Software**  
OpenVSP: For 3D modeling and parameterized geometry of the firefighting aircraft.  
ANSYS Fluent: For performing CFD simulations of the airflow and aerodynamic properties.  
Python: For post-processing data and performing stability analysis.
